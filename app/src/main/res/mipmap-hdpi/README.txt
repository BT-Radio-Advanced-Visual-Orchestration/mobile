App icons should be placed in this directory.
Use Android Studio's Image Asset tool to generate proper icon sizes:
Right-click res → New → Image Asset

Required files:
- ic_launcher.png (launcher icon)
- ic_launcher_round.png (round launcher icon)

This is a placeholder directory. Default Android icons will be used until custom icons are added.
