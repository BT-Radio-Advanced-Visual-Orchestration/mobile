# BRAVO Mobile - Android Application

Android application for the B.R.A.V.O (Beacon-Relay-Asset-View-Orchestration) IoT system. This app connects to ESP32-based relay devices via USB or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to access LoRa telemetry data, and displays GPS location information on an interactive map with offline support.

**Important**: This mobile app does NOT receive LoRa radio signals directly. LoRa information is only accessible on the phone through:
- **ESP32 Relay Device**: The phone connects to an ESP32 device (via USB or BLE) which receives LoRa transmissions from collars/dongles
- **API/Dashboard**: Alternative access through a web API or dashboard interface (future feature)

## Features

- **Dual Connection Support**: Connect to ESP32 relay devices via USB or BLE
- **LoRa Telemetry Reception**: Access GPS telemetry data transmitted via LoRa through the ESP32 relay
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Display real-time GPS tracking on OpenStreetMap
- **Offline Map Support**: View maps without internet connectivity using cached tiles
- **Real-time Telemetry Display**: View latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, signal strength, and battery level
- **Background Services**: Continuous data reception via foreground services
- **GPS Path Tracking**: Visual trail of device movement on the map

## Architecture Overview

The BRAVO system uses a **relay architecture** for LoRa communication:

```
[GPS Collar/Dongle] --LoRa Radio--> [ESP32 Relay] --USB/BLE--> [Android Phone]
                                          ^
                                          |
                                     Receives LoRa
                                     transmissions
```

The mobile phone **cannot receive LoRa radio directly**. Instead:
1. GPS collar/dongle devices transmit location data via LoRa radio
2. An ESP32 relay device receives these LoRa transmissions
3. The mobile app connects to the ESP32 relay (via USB or BLE)
4. Telemetry data is forwarded from the relay to the phone

## Architecture

The project follows Android best practices with a modular structure:

```
app/src/main/java/com/bravo/mobile/
├── activities/          # UI Activities
│   ├── MainActivity.java
│   ├── MapActivity.java
│   └── SettingsActivity.java
├── services/           # Background Services
│   ├── BLEConnectionService.java
│   ├── LoRaReceiverService.java
│   └── UsbBroadcastReceiver.java
├── libs/              # Core Libraries
│   ├── LoRaReceiver.java
│   ├── TelemetryParser.java
│   └── MapVisualization.java
├── models/            # Data Models
│   ├── TelemetryData.java
│   └── LoRaPacket.java
└── utils/             # Utility Classes
    └── Constants.java
```

**Data Flow**: LoRa packets are received by the ESP32 relay device and forwarded to the phone via USB or BLE connection.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 26+ (Android 8.0 Oreo)
- Target SDK 34 (Android 14)
- Java 8+
- Gradle 8.0+

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beacon-relay-asset-view-orchestration/mobile.git
cd mobile
```

### 2. Open in Android Studio

1. Launch Android Studio
2. Select "Open an Existing Project"
3. Navigate to the cloned repository and select the project folder
4. Wait for Gradle sync to complete

### 3. Configure Google Maps API Key (Optional)

If you want to use Google Maps instead of OpenStreetMap:

1. Get an API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Open `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
3. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY" />
```

### 4. Build the Project

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Or use Android Studio:
- Menu: Build → Make Project (Ctrl+F9 / Cmd+F9)

### 5. Run on Device or Emulator

```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

Or use Android Studio:
- Menu: Run → Run 'app' (Shift+F10)

**Note**: For USB connections, you must use a physical Android device with OTG support.

## Usage

### Connecting via Bluetooth (BLE)

1. Launch the BRAVO Mobile app
2. Tap "Connect via Bluetooth"
3. Select your ESP32 relay device from the list (devices starting with "ESP32")
4. Wait for connection confirmation
5. Telemetry data from LoRa collars will automatically appear on the main screen

**Note**: The ESP32 relay must be within BLE range and actively receiving LoRa transmissions.

### Connecting via USB

1. Connect ESP32 relay device to your Android device using an OTG cable
2. Launch the BRAVO Mobile app
3. Tap "Connect via USB"
4. Grant USB permission when prompted
5. Telemetry data from LoRa collars will automatically appear on the main screen

**Note**: The ESP32 relay must be receiving LoRa transmissions from GPS collars/dongles for data to appear.

### Viewing GPS Map

1. After connecting to a device, tap "View GPS Map"
2. The map will display the current location from telemetry
3. A blue line shows the tracked path
4. Tap on the location marker to see detailed information

### Offline Maps

Offline maps are automatically enabled. The app will:
- Use cached tiles when available
- Download new tiles when online
- Continue showing cached areas when offline

To pre-download map areas:
1. While connected to WiFi, navigate to desired areas
2. Zoom in and pan around to cache tiles
3. These tiles will be available offline

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- **BLUETOOTH / BLUETOOTH_ADMIN**: For BLE connections
- **BLUETOOTH_SCAN / BLUETOOTH_CONNECT**: Required on Android 12+
- **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION**: Required for BLE scanning and GPS display
- **USB_PERMISSION**: For USB serial communication
- **INTERNET**: For downloading map tiles
- **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**: For caching offline maps (Android 11 and below)
- **FOREGROUND_SERVICE**: For background data reception

## Telemetry Data Format

The app supports two telemetry formats:

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "lat": 37.7749,
  "lon": -122.4194,
  "alt": 50.0,
  "spd": 10.5,
  "dev": "ESP32-001",
  "bat": 85
}
```

### Binary Format
- 4 bytes: Latitude (float)
- 4 bytes: Longitude (float)
- 4 bytes: Altitude (float)
- 4 bytes: Speed (float)
- 1 byte: Battery level (0-100)

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Models**: Add data structures to `models/`
2. **Services**: Add background tasks to `services/`
3. **Libraries**: Add reusable utilities to `libs/`
4. **Activities**: Add new screens to `activities/`

### Testing on Hardware

For best results, test with:
- ESP32 DevKit with LoRa module (SX1276/SX1278) configured as a relay
- GPS collar/dongle with LoRa transmitter
- Android device with BLE 4.0+ support
- USB OTG cable for USB testing

**System Setup**: The ESP32 relay device should be configured to receive LoRa transmissions and forward them via serial (USB) or BLE to the mobile app.

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
adb logcat -s BLEConnectionService LoRaReceiverService MainActivity MapActivity
```

## Troubleshooting

### BLE Connection Issues
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
- Grant location permissions (required for BLE scanning)
- Make sure ESP32 is advertising
- Check device name matches expected format

### USB Connection Issues
- Use a quality OTG cable
- Verify USB host support on your device
- Check USB drivers are loaded
- Grant USB permissions when prompted

### Map Not Loading
- Check internet connection for first load
- Verify storage permissions for offline caching
- Clear app cache if tiles appear corrupted
- Zoom out and pan to refresh tiles

### No Telemetry Data
- Verify ESP32 relay is receiving LoRa transmissions
- Verify GPS collar/dongle is transmitting via LoRa
- Check serial baud rate matches (115200)
- Ensure LoRa frequency and settings match between collar and relay
- Review packet format matches expected structure
- Check that collar/dongle is within LoRa range of the relay
